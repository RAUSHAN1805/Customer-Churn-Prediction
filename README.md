Customer retention is a critical aspect of every business, particularly in the retail industry, where competition is fierce and customer loyalty is highly valued.
Customer retention is a critical aspect of every business, particularly in the retail industry, where competition is fierce and customer loyalty is highly valued. It is often more expensive to acquire new customers than it is to retain existing ones. Furthermore, retained customers are often more profitable, as they are more likely to make repeat purchases and recommend the business to others.With this in mind, this project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn, enabling the company to identify customers who are at risk of leaving so that proactive retention strategies can be implemented.
